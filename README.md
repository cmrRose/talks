### "Designing for Scientists"
Wisconsin Land Information Association (WLIA) Annual Meeting  

March 7–9, 2018 | Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin 

slides: https://github.com/cmrRose/talks/blob/master/wlia2018_Designing-for-Scientists.pdf 

abstract:  
Mapping scientific data and research calls for clarity, readability, detail, and synthesis. As map-makers, we can use the principles of good visual design to meet those needs.  Design principles such as visual hierarchy, color, and consistency can be used to facilitate meaningful comparisons and to highlight distribution, correlation, and other relationships that are key to understanding the science. 
As a cartographer for the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, I create maps that appear in my colleagues’ publications on geology and hydrogeology. My design process is always a conversation; I work with each scientist to visually depict their understanding of the data for the publication’s readers. In this presentation, I will discuss our workflow, recommend some design tools and resources, and demonstrate how good visual design can lead to more effective communication.
